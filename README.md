General tips to keep in mind:
* Always ask for clarification questions in prticular see for edge cases, test conditions, check for null conditions.
* While coming up for solutions, speak your mind. List out all possible solution methods with their time and space complexity. Then, go ahead and write the best solution. Keep in mind to test for edge and null cases. Go step by step while writing your solution.
* Always modularize your code. Ask if you can assume that boilerplate code has been provided or not. You can then go ahead and fill up the functions in your code.
